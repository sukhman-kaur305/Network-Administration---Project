# Network-Administration---Project
Completed a comprehensive CIDR and subnetting project in Network Administration (IT2B), involving:

Binary and decimal IP computation for accurate address planning
Subnetting Class A/B/C networks to meet custom requirements (2–1300+ subnets)
Calculating new subnet masks, usable host counts, and broadcast IDs
Analyzing IP ranges using bitwise operations and subnet boundaries
Validating host addresses to determine whether they lie within the same subnet
Designing supernetted (aggregated) networks for optimal routing efficiency

Skills Applied:
CIDR · VLSM · Subnet Mask Derivation · Network ID Computation · Broadcast ID Identification · IP Range Calculation · Supernetting · Route Summarization · Binary Network Math
